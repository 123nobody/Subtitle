Dialogue: 0,0:25:28.37,0:25:32.03,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,and then the controller simply\N{\fs14}tunes into that radio station.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:32.31,0:25:33.79,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,And it can find out\N{\fs14}things are changing.

Dialogue: 0,0:28:18.06,0:28:21.44,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? So, that basically\N{\fs14}results in a picture
Dialogue: 0,0:28:21.44,0:28:22.73,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,that looks kind of like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:23.42,0:28:24.71,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Alright? Where you got this MVC
Dialogue: 0,0:28:24.71,0:28:26.42,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,and you see the purple\N{\fs14}one that's

Dialogue: 0,0:28:53.11,0:28:54.40,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,And so it's modular in that way.

Dialogue: 0,0:29:12.85,0:29:15.37,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,But that's the only kind of\N{\fs14}communication you're going

Dialogue: 0,0:34:03.34,0:34:05.64,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? It's this kind of basic\N{\fs14}class, we'll talk about it
Dialogue: 0,0:34:05.64,0:34:07.75,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,when we talk about\N{\fs14}foundation, but it's going
Dialogue: 0,0:34:07.75,0:34:10.44,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,to be the superclass eventually\N{\fs14}of every single class.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:10.60,0:34:13.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Right? Everything, eventually,\N{\fs14}inherits from NSObject.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:13.58,0:34:17.55,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Now, on the implementation\N{\fs14}side, it looks very similar,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:17.55,0:34:19.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,but instead of saying\N{\fs14}at sign interface,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:19.09,0:34:22.24,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,you say at sign implementation\N{\fs14}and the name of the class.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:22.24,0:34:25.42,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,And here you don't specify\N{\fs14}your superclass, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:25.83,0:34:27.65,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Because you're only allowed\N{\fs14}to specify that once,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:27.86,0:34:30.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,and its public, so it\N{\fs14}goes in your header file.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:30.39,0:34:32.15,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Notice that the bottom\N{\fs14}of both of these,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:32.15,0:34:33.77,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,little at sign end,\N{\fs14}do you see that?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:34.37,0:34:37.00,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay, that just means that's\N{\fs14}the end of the interface
Dialogue: 0,0:34:37.00,0:34:38.12,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,or of the implantation.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:38.75,0:34:41.52,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? So all of your\N{\fs14}public API goes inside this
Dialogue: 0,0:34:41.52,0:34:43.90,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,at sign interface\N{\fs14}block, at sign interface,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:43.90,0:34:47.61,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,and all of your implementation,\N{\fs14}your private implementation goes
Dialogue: 0,0:34:47.61,0:34:49.52,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,in the at sign implementation\N{\fs14}part.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:49.91,0:34:54.71,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Now, if you import, if you have\N{\fs14}specified your superclass here,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:54.71,0:34:55.84,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,you have to import it.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:56.18,0:34:57.88,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? Which is like\N{\fs14}pound sign, include.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:57.88,0:35:00.36,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,It's a little more powerful than\N{\fs14}pound sign, include, in fact,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:00.36,0:35:02.22,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,it's a lot more powerful,\N{\fs14}as I'll talk
Dialogue: 0,0:35:02.22,0:35:02.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,about in a second here.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:03.23,0:35:04.56,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,>> But you must import it,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:04.56,0:35:07.23,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,otherwise the objective-C\N{\fs14}compiler won't know what
Dialogue: 0,0:35:07.23,0:35:08.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,that superclass is, so\N{\fs14}you have to, obviously,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:08.95,0:35:10.12,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,import your superclass.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:10.12,0:35:11.58,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,However, we don't usually,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:11.78,0:35:14.53,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,when our superclass is\N{\fs14}something that's in iOS,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:14.92,0:35:17.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,we don't usually import just\N{\fs14}that classes header file,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:17.92,0:35:19.21,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,which in this case\N{\fs14}is foundation,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:19.58,0:35:22.03,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,we actually import\N{\fs14}the entire framework.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:23.13,0:35:26.20,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? Now you might say,\N{\fs14}oh, that's inefficient.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:26.80,0:35:28.77,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,[Pause] A huge framework,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:28.77,0:35:32.57,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,but of course this is all\N{\fs14}precompiled and optimized.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:32.78,0:35:36.66,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,And, in fact, in iOS7, the\N{\fs14}syntax for this is really to say
Dialogue: 0,0:35:36.66,0:35:38.81,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,at sign import foundation.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:39.21,0:35:42.14,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,That means I'm going to\N{\fs14}use all the public classes
Dialogue: 0,0:35:42.47,0:35:43.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,in the foundation framework.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:44.15,0:35:48.56,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,iOS7 still supports the old\N{\fs14}important foundation slash
Dialogue: 0,0:35:48.56,0:35:51.29,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,foundation.h so you can\N{\fs14}use that if you want.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:51.86,0:35:53.53,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Now on our implementation file,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:53.80,0:35:56.73,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,we have to import our\N{\fs14}header file, obviously.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:57.24,0:35:59.22,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? Because our\N{\fs14}implementation file needs
Dialogue: 0,0:35:59.22,0:36:03.47,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,to know what we're committing to\N{\fs14}publicly, in terms of our API,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:03.82,0:36:04.88,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,so we have to import that.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:05.14,0:36:07.29,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Makes perfect sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:07.40,0:36:11.80,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,We can also have private\N{\fs14}declarations, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:11.80,0:36:15.73,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Declarations of properties and\N{\fs14}methods that are private inside
Dialogue: 0,0:36:16.24,0:36:18.98,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,of our implementation file\N{\fs14}by putting this little
Dialogue: 0,0:36:18.98,0:36:20.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,at sign interface,\N{\fs14}name of our class,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:21.06,0:36:22.66,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,open parentheses,\N{\fs14}closed parentheses.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:23.57,0:36:24.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? And then at sign end.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:24.95,0:36:26.25,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,So we can have a\N{\fs14}little space here
Dialogue: 0,0:36:26.25,0:36:27.88,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,where we can little\N{\fs14}private declarations.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:27.88,0:36:30.48,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Now, objective-C\N{\fs14}does not require you
Dialogue: 0,0:36:30.52,0:36:33.63,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,to declare something\N{\fs14}before you use it in a file,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:34.00,0:36:34.73,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,you know what I mean by that?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:34.73,0:36:37.25,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,And there's a lot,\N{\fs14}a lot of languages,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:37.47,0:36:40.34,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,you have to declare a method\N{\fs14}before you can call it, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:40.62,0:36:42.27,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,But you can do it out\N{\fs14}of order in objective-C,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:42.27,0:36:44.68,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,you can implement a\N{\fs14}method here that calls,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:44.99,0:36:47.43,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,you can implement\N{\fs14}method A, calls method B,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:47.43,0:36:50.15,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,and then method B is implemented\N{\fs14}down here later in the file.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:50.46,0:36:52.36,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? So you don't have\N{\fs14}to declare method B first,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:52.82,0:36:56.67,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,then implement method A, and\N{\fs14}then implement method B. So,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:56.92,0:37:00.00,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,this little private at sign\N{\fs14}interface we're mostly going
Dialogue: 0,0:37:00.00,0:37:01.08,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,to use for properties.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:01.45,0:37:04.84,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? Because when we declare\N{\fs14}a property, as you'll see,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:04.84,0:37:06.64,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,that setter and getter\N{\fs14}get written for us.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:06.89,0:37:09.93,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,So let's see what that looks\N{\fs14}like to declare a property.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:10.04,0:37:11.90,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,So here's a simple property.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:12.13,0:37:13.28,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,It's called contents.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:13.45,0:37:15.18,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,So this is the content\N{\fs14}of the card.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:15.18,0:37:16.59,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,This is what's on the card.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:17.06,0:37:18.87,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,So this might be ace of clubs.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:19.52,0:37:23.20,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? And because this\N{\fs14}is your first day,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:23.33,0:37:26.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,we're going to make the contents\N{\fs14}be very simple, just a string.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:26.45,0:37:29.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? So these cards, they can\N{\fs14}be like a flashcard, maybe,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:29.78,0:37:31.70,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,for learning a foreign\N{\fs14}language, maybe this is the,

Dialogue: 0,0:37:47.90,0:37:49.38,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,and then the character clubs,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:49.43,0:37:52.83,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,because there's Unicode\N{\fs14}character clubs, so the A clubs,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:52.83,0:37:53.65,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,that would be the content.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:53.65,0:37:56.06,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,So this is the content of\N{\fs14}the card, what's on the card.

Dialogue: 0,0:56:42.97,0:56:46.65,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,card is the iteration variable,\N{\fs14}and execute that if once
Dialogue: 0,0:56:46.78,0:56:47.99,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,for each of the cards\N{\fs14}in the array.
Dialogue: 0,0:56:47.99,0:56:50.11,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Everyone understand that?
Dialogue: 0,0:56:50.11,0:56:55.98,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,If you have a question\N{\fs14}about that, ask?
Dialogue: 0,0:56:56.85,0:56:59.15,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,No? Yeah? [Inaudible\N{\fs14}background comment] Oh, okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:56:59.15,0:56:59.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,That's a great question.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:00.19,0:57:02.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,So the question is if I\N{\fs14}just have that four-line,
Dialogue: 0,0:57:02.78,0:57:04.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,but I said four card card,
Dialogue: 0,0:57:04.86,0:57:09.21,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,not four card star card,\N{\fs14}in other cards, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:57:09.55,0:57:10.68,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,We'd get a syntax error.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:11.05,0:57:13.84,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Why? Because all objects\N{\fs14}are always pointed
Dialogue: 0,0:57:13.84,0:57:15.44,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,to so we always have that star.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:16.00,0:57:17.19,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? Always.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:17.50,0:57:21.99,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Alright? You can't have a card\N{\fs14}not being a pointer to it,
Dialogue: 0,0:57:21.99,0:57:25.23,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,so the, you know, objective-C\N{\fs14}would give you a syntax error
Dialogue: 0,0:57:25.23,0:57:27.37,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,there, it's impossible\N{\fs14}to not have that star.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:27.76,0:57:29.61,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Whenever you have the\N{\fs14}name of the class,
Dialogue: 0,0:57:29.91,0:57:33.65,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,it's always going\N{\fs14}to have that star.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:34.67,0:57:36.05,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Question? [Inaudible\N{\fs14}background comment] Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:36.05,0:57:37.35,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,The question is,\N{\fs14}another great one,
Dialogue: 0,0:57:37.76,0:57:40.69,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,can I use the square\N{\fs14}brackets to call the setter
Dialogue: 0,0:57:40.69,0:57:42.58,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,and getter instead of\N{\fs14}using that dot notation?
Dialogue: 0,0:57:42.62,0:57:44.73,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,And that's a really\N{\fs14}insightful question
Dialogue: 0,0:57:44.73,0:57:47.48,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,and the answer is absolutely\N{\fs14}you can, it's perfectly legal,
Dialogue: 0,0:57:47.48,0:57:50.29,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,because that setter and getter\N{\fs14}are completely normal methods.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:50.36,0:57:52.25,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,There's nothing special\N{\fs14}about them whatsoever.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:52.71,0:57:56.66,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? That dot notation is a\N{\fs14}nicety, syntactic sugar only.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:57.49,0:57:59.96,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,The question is should you\N{\fs14}use square brackets for setter
Dialogue: 0,0:57:59.96,0:58:02.65,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,and getter, and I think\N{\fs14}it's a matter of style.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:02.68,0:58:05.03,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,You would definitely would want\N{\fs14}to be 100 percent consistent,
Dialogue: 0,0:58:05.03,0:58:06.19,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,you would never want\N{\fs14}to mix them.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:06.73,0:58:08.08,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,And I think most people,
Dialogue: 0,0:58:08.08,0:58:10.27,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,most people would say\N{\fs14}use the dot notation.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:10.27,0:58:13.36,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,It makes it clearer, it's\N{\fs14}a little simpler, nicer,
Dialogue: 0,0:58:13.64,0:58:15.27,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,but, you know, you could.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:15.27,0:58:17.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,In this class, please\N{\fs14}use the dot notation just
Dialogue: 0,0:58:17.09,0:58:18.98,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,so I know you know how\N{\fs14}to use dot notation.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:19.50,0:58:21.04,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Question? [Inaudible\N{\fs14}background comment] Okay,
Dialogue: 0,0:58:21.70,0:58:26.19,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,awesome question again.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:26.33,0:58:27.48,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Gosh, you guys are so good.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:28.00,0:58:32.01,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Can I use dot notation for a\N{\fs14}method that takes no arguments,
Dialogue: 0,0:58:32.39,0:58:34.01,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,but is not a getter or a setter?
Dialogue: 0,0:58:34.58,0:58:37.72,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,And the answer is objective-C\N{\fs14}will warn you about that,
Dialogue: 0,0:58:37.92,0:58:39.52,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,not give you an error,\N{\fs14}but warn you,
Dialogue: 0,0:58:39.79,0:58:41.25,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,and you should never\N{\fs14}do that in this class.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:41.60,0:58:43.97,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? That is really\N{\fs14}not that good form,
Dialogue: 0,0:58:44.16,0:58:46.74,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,whereas his question was\N{\fs14}kind of like you can argue,
Dialogue: 0,0:58:46.81,0:58:47.79,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,that one, don't do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:47.97,0:58:52.56,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Okay? So. Use dot notations\N{\fs14}only for setters and getters.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:52.72,0:58:53.54,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Other questions?
Dialogue: 0,0:58:53.88,0:58:53.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,Yeah?

Dialogue: 0,0:59:02.63,0:59:04.11,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,And it's exactly the\N{\fs14}same as a getter,
Dialogue: 0,0:59:04.41,0:59:05.70,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,it's just that you're using it
Dialogue: 0,0:59:05.70,0:59:07.36,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,on the left-hand\N{\fs14}side of an equals.
Dialogue: 0,0:59:07.86,0:59:11.80,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,So card.contents equals,\N{\fs14}you know, A of clubs,
Dialogue: 0,0:59:12.15,0:59:15.49,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,that would call the setter of\N{\fs14}contents, whereas, you know,
Dialogue: 0,0:59:15.57,0:59:17.33,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,this is calling the\N{\fs14}getter, because it's not
